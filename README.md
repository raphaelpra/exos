# flotpython exos

this repo contains exercises and TPs that [complement the Python MOOC](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/cours/python-3-des-fondamentaux-aux-concepts-avances-du-langage/)

excluded are the auto-corrected exercises mentioned in the MOOC
[bundled in the main course repo](https://github.com/flotpython/course);  
that was historically for technical reasons, although it is not clear that it's
still relevant

in any case, in the present repo we try to gather all the other, generally more
informal, material for practising Python and/or the Data-Science ecosystem

## there is no runtime tool here !

also note that, as opposed to the auto-corrected exercises mentioned above,
there is a **deliberate choice to not provide a notebooks infrastructure**  
this is because we want our students to become autonomous, so it means they are
supposed to solve all these problems **on their own laptop**, where they are
expected to have acquired the skills for installing and managing a decent
software stack (typically bash + vscode + python + ipython + jupyter)  
the fact that most of the material is written as a notebook is mostly a
convenience, both for authoring (outputs are up-to-date), and of course in cases
where the starting material is a notebook itself  
if you can really not install anything on your laptop, you can in last resort
use [the emergency resources at the bottom of this page](label-lite-tools)

## contents

the material is organized along these rather vague categories:

- stuff about [pure Python](https://flotpython-exos-python.readthedocs.io/)
- and about [Data-Science ecosystem](https://flotpython-exos-ds.readthedocs.io/) (i.e. numpy pandas matplotlib and related)

and in each category we try to make a distinction between

* `exos`: short, simple one-shot assignments
* `tps`: more elaborate assignments, with several steps, that let students
  achieve something
* `howtos`: more for reading than for practising, that can be recipes to achieve
  some common tasks

as well as, less interesting probably:

* `samples`: miscell pieces of code that can come in handy
* `reading`: the idea was to gather full-length projects, that students could
  read; may disappear on the long run, and merged with `samples`

## formats & jupytext

as noted above, most of the contents is written as notebooks; all notebooks are
jupytext-encoded using either `py:percent` or `md:myst` formats  
you will **need to `pip install jupytext`** to be able to read those as notebooks  
also all notebooks have their filename prefix ending in `-nb` to help the
distinction between notebooks and pure Python or pure markdown

## note on autoreload in ipython or notebooks

please read this through if you use IPython or Jupyter on your laptop

### the problem

you are in `ipython` or in a notebook and you do

```
from my_module import my_function
my_function(...)
```

then later on, you modify `my_module.py` under vs-code, and you want to try the
new version; your first idea is to redo the import to load the new version into
your interpreter

when then, **BEWARE** because **a second `import` will not reload the file**  
this is intended, and desirable, because loading a module is costly; so the
interpreter caches its loaded modules, and long story short, you can re-import
as much as you want, you still run the old code !

### the solution

**to work around this situation**: with the trick that follows, you won't even
need to re-import, you will just need to re-run `my_function()` and you will use
the latest version (provided that the new module actually has no error that
prevents it from loading, of course)

you just need to add in a file named

```
~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py
```

the following lines

```python
c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = []
c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines.append('%load_ext autoreload')
c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines.append('%autoreload 2')
```

to achieve that, if you have bash-compatible terminal (like for example on
windows: git for bash), you can just cut-and-paste the following snippet to
configure that on your computer:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ipython/profile_default
cat >> ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py << EOF
c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = []
c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines.append('%load_ext autoreload')
c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines.append('%autoreload 2')
EOF
```

## last resort computing resources

if you really cannot install anything on your laptop, you can use this instead  
this is a best effort, not everything works exactly like on a laptop  

you should first check whether you can effectively save your work; in
particular, keep in mind that the only place where your work is likely to be
saved is .. in the brower itself; so for example using another browser, or *a
fortiori* another computer, will likely make you lose your work
