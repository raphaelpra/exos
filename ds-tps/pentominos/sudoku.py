def exact_cover_input(sudoku):
    """
    input is expected to be a 9x9 numpy array containing
    the sudoku board encoded with 0 for empty cells

    some examples are defined in sudoku_data.py

    the output is a tuple:
    - is a numpy boolean representing this grid, to be fed into an exact cover solver
    - a dictionary that maps the row index in the boolean array to the (i, j, k) tuple

    when no cell are known, the array will have
    - fewer than 324 rows:
      81 constraints for cells, 81for rows, 81 for columns, and 81 for boxes
    - fewer than 729 columns (81 cells * 9 possible digits)

    assuming the problem has n known cells, the actual outcome will have a
    reduced number of rows and of columns in the following way:
    - rows = 4 * (81-n)
    - columns: there are fewer columns because
        - the known positions are not encoded
        - also the positions that are obviously not possible are not encoded either
          e.g. if we know that cell (1, 0) contains '4' like in BOARD_29a, then
          we know that cell (0, 0) cannot contain '4' either
        see section 7.2.2.1 p. 11 of D. Knuth's TAOCP for the full example of BOARD_29a
