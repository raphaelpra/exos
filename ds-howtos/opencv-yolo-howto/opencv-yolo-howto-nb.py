# ## images
#
# in a first part, we'll deal with images

# ### reading and displaying an image
#
# openCV comes with its own API for displaying and interacting with an image
#
# ````{admonition} warning
#
# we use our own function `show_image` - and actually we will use it all the time (see its code in `utils_image.py`); here's what it does:
#
# * it displays an image in a separate window
# * and waits for you to close the window; for that you can either
#     - type a character - any character
#     - left-click
#     - or use the system shortcut to close a window (Alt-F4 or Command-w)
#
# once you do it, **and only then**, the window is destroyed and one can **go ahead with the notebook**
# ````

# ## dealing with videos
#
# let us now see how opencv can help display and deal with videos

# ### display a video and react to mouse events
#
# in this first example, we are going to
#
# - display a short video
# - let the user click with the mouse, and add a red circle at the clicked position
# - user can also quit earlier by typing 'q'
#
# feel free to first watch the video in `./media/cars-city.mp4` using your usual viewer, so you can see the changes.

import cv2
from IPython.display import Image


# +
# for starters we define a 'callback'
# i.e. a function that will be called
# each time an event occurs
# in our case the event is: "user has clicked"

# its purpose is to store 3 global variables
# mouse-x mouse-y and color
# that can then be used by the rest of the code

def mouse_callback(event, x, y, flags, param):

    # we keep track of the last clicked position
    # and color in these global variables
    global mouse_x, mouse_y, color

    # just to illustrate how to know which
    # mouse button was used
    if event == cv2.EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN:
        print("Left Pressed", x, y)
        mouse_x, mouse_y = (x, y)
        # remember, this is RED
        color = (0, 0, 255)
    if event == cv2.EVENT_RBUTTONDOWN:
        print("Right Pressed", x, y)
        mouse_x, mouse_y = (x, y)
        # and this is GREEN
        color = (0, 255, 0)


# + tags=["skip-execution"]
# and now we can write the code for achieving the goal (see above)

# being global, these variables can be read
# by all the code below
# reset then here:
# we don't want to inherit the click from previous runs
mouse_x, mouse_y, color = None, None, None

# load the video - it will empty as we read it with capture.read()
capture = cv2.VideoCapture("./media/cars-city.mp4")

# using .read(), we can get each video frame individually
# so we can
# - display the video frame
# - and a colored circle if there has been a click previously

# some constants

window_name = "image"
window_x, window_y = (0, 0)


# initialize
cv2.namedWindow(window_name)

# we can now loop ever the video

# the return from capture.read() is a tuple with
# ret: bool      if False, the video is over
# frame: image   otherwise, frame contains the next image
ret, frame = capture.read()

# until the end of the video
while ret:

    # arbitrarily, make the video half its size
    frame = cv2.resize(frame, (0, 0), fx=0.5, fy=0.5)

    # if a click has occurred, let's add a colored circle
    if mouse_x is not None:
        cv2.circle(frame, (mouse_x, mouse_y), radius, color, line_width)
    # while we're at it, add a frame around the image

                  # rectangle size
                  (10, 10), (frame.shape[1]-10, frame.shape[0]-10),
                  # rectangle color and linewidth
                  (0, 255, 255), 2)

    # shows in the foreground
