# There is a decoding error, wich means the csv is not encoded  in utf-8. This is unfortunate and the real encoding is not specified on the site. Instead of making trial and fail attempts, we will use `chardet` to detect the correct encoding.

# %%
# %pip install chardet

import chardet
import urllib.request

rawdata = urllib.request.urlopen(URL).read()
chardet.detect(rawdata)

# %% [markdown]
# The encoding seems to be `ISO-8859-1` with 0.73% confidence. Let's try it

    hos = pd.read_csv(URL, encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# **It works, but the x-axis date representation is messy.**
# It is an issue specific to the bar plot in pandas. With a regular line plot, the x-axis is automatically optimized.
